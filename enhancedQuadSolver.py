    Computes the solutions of the quadratic equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
    
    This function uses the quadratic formula, where the discriminant (D) is given by:

    The discriminant determines:
      - Two distinct real solutions if D > 0.
      - One real solution (a double root) if D == 0.
      - Two complex solutions if D < 0.
